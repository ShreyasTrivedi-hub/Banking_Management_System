//BANKING SYSTEM IN JAVA PLUS JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY (JDBC)

/*🔧 Setting up the Development Environment: We'll start by setting up your Java development environment,
 ensuring you have all the necessary tools and libraries.
🏦 Creating a Database: You'll learn how to design a database schema for our Banking System using MySQL or
 any database system of your choice. We'll guide you through creating tables for users and accounts,
 setting up relationships, and defining constraints.
☕ Java JDBC Connectivity: We'll show you how to connect Java to your database using JDBC,
 a crucial skill for any database-driven application.
📝 User Registration and Login: You'll implement user registration and login functionality,
 allowing users to create accounts and access their accounts securely.
💰 Managing Accounts: Learn how to create, debit, credit, transfer money, and check balances in user accounts.
🔐 Implementing Security Measures: We'll discuss best practices for securing user data and transactions within your Banking System.
🖥️ User-Friendly Interface: While we'll focus on backend functionality,
   we'll provide guidance on how to create a user-friendly interface if you want to expand this project
   further.
